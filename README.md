This project is aimed to provide the simplest way to install kubernetes on bare-metal systems.
Actually, only Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) amd64 is supported, but many other systems will be available soon.


This project is still under development. 
Feedback is very welcome via the
[GitHub site](https://github.com/pierreilki/k8s-distrib-2)

## What is IlkiKube

Getting a passing badge is a significant achievement;
on average only about 10% of pursuing projects have a passing badge.
That said, some projects would like to meet even stronger criteria,
and many users would like projects to do so.
We have established two higher levels beyond passing: silver and gold.
The higher levels strengthen some of the passing criteria and add new
criteria of their own.
